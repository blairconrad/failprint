# Woof

Write Only On Failure.

*:warning: Work in progress!*

Tired of searching the `quiet` options of your programs
to lighten up the output of your `make check` or `make lint` commands?

Tired of finding out that standard output and error are mixed up in some of them?

Simply run your command through `woof`. If it succeeds, nothing is printed. If it fails, standard error is printed.
Plus other configuration goodies :wink:
